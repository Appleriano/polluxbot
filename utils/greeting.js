    own: `**Greetings, dear new boss!** If you're reading this is because you, or someone of your trust invited me to one of your servers, most specifically the **{{server}}** one! Let me introduce myself:

I'm **Pollux**, a little assistant-in-training for your Discordy needs.
I'm still new, less than a year, so I'm counting on you to help me improve and grow as a bot!
If you ever notice something wrong or wonky about me, don't hesitate in joining my support server and report it!

**Here's a quick Pollux 101 guide of my basics for first-time use**
- My prefix is **+** so if you have any other bots sharing this prefix it's advised to change my one, ~~or ditch the other bot teehee~~
You can do so by using \`+prefixSet [prefix]\` (do not include the brackets).
In case you mess up, you can always try using the command by mentioning me like \`@Pollux prefixSet +\`.
And if you can't get this right, you can try the \`pollux+nuke\` command to __**reset all my settings for your server**__ .

**Currently I can speak the following languages: :flag_gb: :flag_br: **
- Switch the language I speak by using \`+speak [en | pt]\`
If you want any other language, and are willing to translate it, come over the Support Server and my master will hand you my files for you to translate.

- You may want to tell me which are your Mods, you can do so by setting a ModRole with \`+modrole [@Role]\`.
Only users with **Administrator** permissions can set this up.
Anyone with **Manage Server** permissions can use Mod-Only commands except for this one.

**Other useful commands:**
\`\`\`js
+disable lvup <s or c> // Disable Level Up Messages in Server or Channel
+enable drops <s or c> // Enable Ruby drops in Server or Channel
+feats                 // Check which are the newest features added
+profile  <@mention>   // See your PPC - Pollux Profile Card ™
+help                  // Full List of Commands
\`\`\`
*< > are optional params*
